                  <p class="small">In recent years, many accurate decision support systems have been constructed as black boxes, that is as systems that hide their internal logic to the user. This lack of explanation constitutes both a practical and an ethical issue. The literature reports many approaches aimed at overcoming this crucial weakness, sometimes at the cost of sacrificing accuracy for interpretability. The applications in which black box decision systems can be used are various, and each approach is typically developed to provide a solution for a specific problem and, as a consequence, it explicitly or implicitly delineates its own definition of interpretability and explanation. The aim of this article is to provide a classification of the main problems addressed in the literature with respect to the notion of explanation and the type of black box system. Given a problem definition, a black box type, and a desired explanation, this survey should help the researcher to find the proposals more useful for his own work. The proposed classification of approaches to open black box models should also be useful for putting the many research open questions in perspective.</p>

We introduce a local rule-based explanation method, providing faithful explanations of the decision made by a black box classifier on a specific instance. The proposed method first learns an interpretable, local classifier on a synthetic neighborhood of the instance under investigation, generated by a genetic algorithm. Then, it derives from the interpretable classifier an explanation consisting of a decision rule, explaining the factual reasons of the decision, and a set of counterfactuals, suggesting the changes in the instance features that would lead to a different outcome. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in terms of the quality of the explanations and of the accuracy in mimicking the black box.</p>

                  <p class="small">Artificial Intelligence (AI) has come to prominence as one of the major components of our society, with applications in most aspects of our lives. In this field, complex and highly nonlinear machine learning models such as ensemble models, deep neural networks, and Support Vector Machines have consistently shown remarkable accuracy in solving complex tasks. Although accurate, AI models often are “black boxes” which we are not able to understand. Relying on these models has a multifaceted impact and raises significant concerns about their transparency. Applications in sensitive and critical domains are a strong motivational factor in trying to understand the behavior of black boxes. We propose to address this issue by providing an interpretable layer on top of black box models by aggregating “local” explanations. We present GLocalX, a “local-first” model agnostic explanation method. Starting from local explanations expressed in form of local decision rules, GLocalX iteratively generalizes them into global explanations by hierarchically aggregating them. Our goal is to learn accurate yet simple interpretable models to emulate the given black box, and, if possible, replace it entirely. We validate GLocalX in a set of experiments in standard and constrained settings with limited or no access to either data or local explanations. Experiments show that GLocalX is able to accurately emulate several models with simple and small models, reaching state-of-the-art performance against natively global solutions. Our findings show how it is often possible to achieve a high level of both accuracy and comprehensibility of classification models, even in complex domains with high-dimensional data, without necessarily trading one property for the other. This is a key requirement for a trustworthy AI, necessary for adoption in high-stakes decision making applications.</p>

                  <p class="small">The recent years have witnessed the rise of accurate but obscure decision systems which hide the logic of their internal decision processes to the users. The lack of explanations for the decisions of black box systems is a key ethical issue, and a limitation to the adoption of achine learning components in socially sensitive and safety-critical contexts. Therefore, we need explanations that reveals the reasons why a predictor takes a certain decision. In this paper we focus on the problem of black box outcome explanation, i.e., explaining the reasons of the decision taken on a specific instance. We propose LORE, an agnostic method able to provide interpretable and faithful explanations. LORE first leans a local interpretable predictor on a synthetic neighborhood generated by a genetic algorithm. Then it derives from the logic of the local interpretable predictor a meaningful explanation consisting of: a decision rule, which explains the reasons of the decision; and a set of counterfactual rules, suggesting the changes in the instance's features that lead to a different outcome. Wide experiments show that LORE outperforms existing methods and baselines both in the quality of explanations and in the accuracy in mimicking the black box.</p>

                  <p class="small">Interpretable machine learning aims at unveiling the reasons behind predictions returned by uninterpretable classifiers. One of the most valuable types of explanation consists of counterfactuals. A counterfactual explanation reveals what should have been different in an instance to observe a diverse outcome. For instance, a bank customer asks for a loan that is rejected. The counterfactual explanation consists of what should have been different for the customer in order to have the loan accepted. Recently, there has been an explosion of proposals for counterfactual explainers. The aim of this work is to survey the most recent explainers returning counterfactual explanations. We categorize explainers based on the approach adopted to return the counterfactuals, and we label them according to characteristics of the method and properties of the counterfactuals returned. In addition, we visually compare the explanations, and we report quantitative benchmarking assessing minimality, actionability, stability, diversity, discriminative power, and running time. The results make evident that the current state of the art does not provide a counterfactual explainer able to guarantee all these properties simultaneously.</p>

                  <p class="small">During each stage of a dataset creation and development process, harmful biases can be accidentally introduced, leading to models that perpetuates marginalization and discrimination of minorities, as the role of the data used during the training is critical. We propose an evaluation framework that investigates the impact on classification and explainability of bias mitigation preprocessing techniques used to assess data imbalances concerning minorities' representativeness and mitigate the skewed distributions discovered. Our evaluation focuses on assessing fairness, explainability and performance metrics. We analyze the behavior of local model-agnostic explainers on the original and mitigated datasets to examine whether the proxy models learned by the explainability techniques to mimic the black-boxes disproportionately rely on sensitive attributes, demonstrating biases rooted in the explainers. We conduct several experiments about known biased datasets to demonstrate our proposal’s novelty and effectiveness for evaluation and bias detection purposes.</p>

                  <p class="small">Autoencoders are a powerful yet opaque feature reduction technique, on top of which we propose a novel way for the joint visual exploration of both latent and real space. By interactively exploiting the mapping between latent and real features, it is possible to unveil the meaning of latent features while providing deeper insight into the original variables. To achieve this goal, we exploit and re-adapt existing approaches from eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to understand the relationships between the input and latent features. The uncovered relationships between input features and latent ones allow the user to understand the data structure concerning external variables such as the predictions of a classification model. We developed an interactive framework that visually explores the latent space and allows the user to understand the relationships of the input features with model prediction.</p>

                  <p class="small">At every stage of a supervised learning process, harmful biases can arise and be inadvertently introduced, ultimately leading to marginalization, discrimination, and abuse towards minorities. This phenomenon becomes particularly impactful in the sensitive real-world context of abusive language detection systems, where non-discrimination is difficult to assess. In addition, given the opaqueness of their internal behavior, the dynamics leading a model to a certain decision are often not clear nor accountable, and significant problems of trust could emerge. A robust value-oriented evaluation of models' fairness is therefore necessary. In this paper, we present FairShades, a model-agnostic approach for auditing the outcomes of abusive language detection systems.  Combining explainability and fairness evaluation, FairShades can identify unintended biases and sensitive categories towards which models are most discriminative. This objective is pursued through the auditing of meaningful counterfactuals generated within CheckList framework. We conduct several experiments on BERT-based models to demonstrate our proposal's novelty and effectiveness for unmasking biases. </p>

                  <p class="small">This book presents Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), which aims at producing explainable models that enable human users to understand and appropriately trust the obtained results. The authors discuss the challenges involved in making machine learning-based AI explainable. Firstly, that the explanations must be adapted to different stakeholders (end-users, policy makers, industries, utilities etc.) with different levels of technical knowledge (managers, engineers, technicians, etc.) in different application domains. Secondly, that it is important to develop an evaluation framework and standards in order to measure the effectiveness of the provided explanations at the human and the technical levels. This book gathers research contributions aiming at the development and/or the use of XAI techniques in order to address the aforementioned challenges in different applications such as healthcare, finance, cybersecurity, and document summarization. It allows highlighting the benefits and requirements of using explainable models in different application domains in order to provide guidance to readers to select the most adapted models to their specified problem and conditions. Includes recent developments of the use of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) in order to address the challenges of digital transition and cyber-physical systems; Provides a textual scientific description of the use of XAI in order to address the challenges of digital transition and cyber-physical systems; Presents examples and case studies in order to increase transparency and understanding of the methodological concepts.</p>

                  <p class="small">Time series classification (TSC) is a pervasive and transversal problem in various fields ranging from disease diagnosis to anomaly detection in finance. Unfortunately, the most effective models used by Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems for TSC are not interpretable and hide the logic of the decision process, making them unusable in sensitive domains. Recent research is focusing on explanation methods to pair with the obscure classifier to recover this weakness. However, a TSC approach that is transparent by design and is simultaneously efficient and effective is even more preferable. To this aim, we propose an interpretable TSC method based on the patterns, which is possible to extract from the Matrix Profile (MP) of the time series in the training set. A smart design of the classification procedure allows obtaining an efficient and effective transparent classifier modeled as a decision tree that expresses the reasons for the classification as the presence of discriminative subsequences. Quantitative and qualitative experimentation shows that the proposed method overcomes the state-of-the-art interpretable approaches.</p>

                  <p class="small">Time series shapelets are discriminatory subsequences which are representative of a class, and their similarity to a time series can be used for successfully tackling the time series classification problem. The literature shows that Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems adopting classification models based on time series shapelets can be interpretable, more accurate, and significantly fast. Thus, in order to design a data-agnostic and interpretable classification approach, in this paper we first extend the notion of shapelets to different types of data, i.e., images, tabular and textual data. Then, based on this extended notion of shapelets we propose an interpretable data-agnostic classification method. Since the shapelets discovery can be time consuming, especially for data types more complex than time series, we exploit a notion of prototypes for finding candidate shapelets, and reducing both the time required to find a solution and the variance of shapelets. A wide experimentation on datasets of different types shows that the data-agnostic prototype-based shapelets returned by the proposed method empower an interpretable classification which is also fast, accurate, and stable. In addition, we show and we prove that shapelets can be at the basis of explainable AI methods.</p>

Our framework consists of a trained classifier onto which an explanation module operates.

                  <p class="small">A key issue in critical contexts such as medical diagnosis is the interpretability of the deep learning models adopted in decision-making systems. Research in eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is trying to solve this issue. However, often XAI approaches are only tested on generalist classifier and do not represent realistic problems such as those of medical diagnosis. In this paper, we analyze a case study on skin lesion images where we customize an existing XAI approach for explaining a deep learning model able to recognize different types of skin lesions. The explanation is formed by synthetic exemplar and counter-exemplar images of skin lesion and offers the practitioner a way to highlight the crucial traits responsible for the classification decision. A survey conducted with domain experts, beginners and unskilled people proof that the usage of explanations increases the trust and confidence in the automatic decision system. Also, an analysis of the latent space adopted by the explainer unveils that some of the most frequent skin lesion classes are distinctly separated. This phenomenon could derive from the intrinsic characteristics of each class and, hopefully, can provide support in the resolution of the most frequent misclassifications by human experts.</p>

                  <p class="small">Decision tree classifiers have been proved to be among the most interpretable models due to their intuitive structure that illustrates decision processes in form of logical rules. Unfortunately, more complex tree-based classifiers such as oblique trees and random forests overcome the accuracy of decision trees at the cost of becoming non interpretable. In this paper, we propose a method that takes as input any tree-based classifier and returns a single decision tree able to approximate its behavior. Our proposal merges tree-based classifiers by an intensional and extensional approach and applies a post-hoc explanation strategy. Our experiments shows that the retrieved single decision tree is at least as accurate as the original tree-based model, faithful, and more interpretable.</p>

                  <p class="small">Artificial Intelligence systems often adopt machine learning models encoding complex algorithms with potentially unknown behavior. As the application of these “black box” models grows, it is our responsibility to understand their inner working and formulate them in human-understandable explanations. To this end, we propose a rule-based model-agnostic explanation method that follows a local-to-global schema: it generalizes a global explanation summarizing the decision logic of a black box starting from the local explanations of single predicted instances. We define a scoring system based on a rule relevance score to extract global explanations from a set of local explanations in the form of decision rules. Experiments on several datasets and black boxes show the stability, and low complexity of the global explanations provided by the proposed solution in comparison with baselines and state-of-the-art global explainers.</p>

                  <p class="small">Black box AI systems for automated decision making, often based on machine learning over (big) data, map a user’s features into a class or a score without exposing the reasons why. This is problematic not only for lack of transparency, but also for possible biases inherited by the algorithms from human prejudices and collection artifacts hidden in the training data, which may lead to unfair or wrong decisions. We focus on the urgent open challenge of how to construct meaningful explanations of opaque AI/ML systems, introducing the local-toglobal framework for black box explanation, articulated along three lines: (i) the language for expressing explanations in terms of logic rules, with statistical and causal interpretation; (ii) the inference of local explanations for revealing the decision rationale for a specific case, by auditing the black box in the vicinity of the target instance; (iii), the bottom-up generalization of many local explanations into simple global ones, with algorithms that optimize for quality and comprehensibility. We argue that the local-first approach opens the door to a wide variety of alternative solutions along different dimensions: a variety of data sources (relational, text, images, etc.), a variety of learning problems (multi-label classification, regression, scoring, ranking), a variety of languages for expressing meaningful explanations, a variety of means to audit a black box.</p>

                  <p class="small">Evaluating local explanation methods is a difficult task due to the lack of a shared and universally accepted definition of explanation. In the literature, one of the most common ways to assess the performance of an explanation method is to measure the fidelity of the explanation with respect to the classification of a black box model adopted by an Artificial Intelligent system for making a decision. However, this kind of evaluation only measures the degree of adherence of the local explainer in reproducing the behavior of the black box classifier with respect to the final decision. Therefore, the explanation provided by the local explainer could be different in the content even though it leads to the same decision of the AI system. In this paper, we propose an approach that allows to measure to which extent the explanations returned by local explanation methods are correct with respect to a synthetic ground truth explanation. Indeed, the proposed methodology enables the generation of synthetic transparent classifiers for which the reason for the decision taken, i.e., a synthetic ground truth explanation, is available by design. Experimental results show how the proposed approach allows to easily evaluate local explanations on the ground truth and to characterize the quality of local explanation methods.</p>

The explanations provided consist of a set of exemplar sentences and a set of counter-exemplar sentences. The former are examples classified by the black box with the same label as the text to explain. The latter are examples classified with a different label (a form of counter-factuals). Both are close in meaning to the text to explain, and both are meaningful sentences – albeit they are synthetically generated. xspells generates neighbors of the text to explain in a latent space using Variational Autoencoders for encoding text and decoding latent instances. A decision tree is learned from randomly generated neighbors, and used to drive the selection of the exemplars and counter-exemplars. We report experiments on two datasets showing that xspells outperforms the well-known lime method in terms of quality of explanations, fidelity, and usefulness, and that is comparable to it in terms of stability.</p>

                  <p class="small">Today the state-of-the-art performance in classification is achieved by the so-called “black boxes”, i.e. decision-making systems whose internal logic is obscure. Such models could revolutionize the health-care system, however their deployment in real-world diagnosis decision support systems is subject to several risks and limitations due to the lack of transparency. The typical classification problem in health-care requires a multi-label approach since the possible labels are not mutually exclusive, e.g. diagnoses. We propose MARLENA, a model-agnostic method which explains multi-label black box decisions. MARLENA explains an individual decision in three steps. First, it generates a synthetic neighborhood around the instance to be explained using a strategy suitable for multi-label decisions. It then learns a decision tree on such neighborhood and finally derives from it a decision rule that explains the black box decision. Our experiments show that MARLENA performs well in terms of mimicking the black box behavior while gaining at the same time a notable amount of interpretability through compact decision rules, i.e. rules with limited length.</p>

                  <p class="small">Given the wide use of machine learning approaches based on opaque prediction models, understanding the reasons behind decisions of black box decision systems is nowadays a crucial topic. We address the problem of providing meaningful explanations in the widely-applied image classification tasks. In particular, we explore the impact of changing the neighborhood generation function for a local interpretable model-agnostic explanator by proposing four different variants. All the proposed methods are based on a grid-based segmentation of the images, but each of them proposes a different strategy for generating the neighborhood of the image for which an explanation is required. A deep experimentation shows both improvements and weakness of each proposed approach.</p>

                  <p class="small">We present a method to explain the decisions of black box models for time series classification. The explanation consists of factual and counterfactual shapelet-based rules revealing the reasons for the classification, and of a set of exemplars and counter-exemplars highlighting similarities and differences with the time series under analysis. The proposed method first generates exemplar and counter-exemplar time series in the latent feature space and learns a local latent decision tree classifier. Then, it selects and decodes those respecting the decision rules explaining the decision. Finally, it learns on them a shapelet-tree that reveals the parts of the time series that must, and must not, be contained for getting the returned outcome from the black box. A wide experimentation shows that the proposed method provides faithful, meaningful and interpretable explanations.</p>

                  <p class="small">Synthetic data generation has been widely adopted in software testing, data privacy, imbalanced learning, machine learning explanation, etc. In such contexts, it is important to generate data samples located within “local” areas surrounding specific instances. Local synthetic data can help the learning phase of predictive models, and it is fundamental for methods explaining the local behavior of obscure classifiers. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we introduce a method based on generative operators allowing the synthetic neighborhood generation by applying specific perturbations on a given input instance. The key factor consists in performing a data transformation that makes applicable to any type of data, i.e., data-agnostic. Second, we design a framework for evaluating the goodness of local synthetic neighborhoods exploiting both supervised and unsupervised methodologies. A deep experimentation shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

                  <p class="small">Black box systems for automated decision making, often based on machine learning over (big) data, map a user's features into a class or a score without exposing the reasons why. This is problematic not only for lack of transparency, but also for possible biases hidden in the algorithms, due to human prejudices and collection artifacts hidden in the training data, which may lead to unfair or wrong decisions. We introduce the local-to-global framework for black box explanation, a novel approach with promising early results, which paves the road for a wide spectrum of future developments along three dimensions: (i) the language for expressing explanations in terms of highly expressive logic-based rules, with a statistical and causal interpretation; (ii) the inference of local explanations aimed at revealing the logic of the decision adopted for a specific instance by querying and auditing the black box in the vicinity of the target instance; (iii), the bottom-up generalization of the many local explanations into simple global ones, with algorithms that optimize the quality and comprehensibility of explanations.</p>
