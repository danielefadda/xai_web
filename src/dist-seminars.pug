              p.lead.mb-3 The Distinguished seminars on Explainable AI last for 90 minutes, the first 45 are dedicated to the seminar and the rest to a round table, we will allow some other guests to be able to ask questions to deepen the topic or opening our minds. Our goal is to bring together bright minds to give talks that are focused on various aspects that can affect Explainability and Artificial Intelligence to foster learning and inspirations that matter.

                      p Let us consider a difficult computer vision challenge. Would you want an algorithm to determine whether you should get a biopsy, based on an xray? That's usually a decision made by a radiologist, based on years of training. We know that algorithms haven't worked perfectly for a multitude of other computer vision applications, and biopsy decisions are harder than just about any other application of computer vision that we typically consider. The interesting question is whether it is possible that an algorithm could be a true partner to a physician, rather than making the decision on its own. To do this, at the very least, we would need an interpretable neural network that is as accurate as its black box counterparts.
                      p This talk will discuss two approaches to interpretable neural networks: (1) case-based reasoning, where parts of images are compared to other parts of prototypical images for each class, and (2) neural disentanglement, using a technique called concept whitening. The case-based reasoning technique is strictly better than saliency maps, and the concept whitening technique provides a strict advantage over the posthoc use of concept vectors.

                      p Explanatory Model Analysis Explore, Explain and Examine Predictive Models is a set of methods and tools designed to build better predictive models and to monitor their behaviour in a changing environment. Today, the true bottleneck in predictive modelling is neither the lack of data, nor the lack of computational power, nor inadequate algorithms, nor the lack of flexible models. It is the lack of tools for model exploration (extraction of relationships learned by the model), model explanation (understanding the key factors influencing model decisions) and model examination (identification of model weaknesses and evaluation of model's performance). This book presents a collection of model agnostic methods that may be used for any black-box model together with real-world applications to classification and regression problems.

            hr
            p The use of counterfactuals in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) can benefit from experimental discoveries in psychology on how people create counterfactual alternatives to reality and how they reason from counterfactual conditionals. I discuss the cognitive processes that people rely on when they engage in counterfactual thought, compared to causal thought. I illustrate some of the similarities and differences between counterfactual and causal thought with evidence from our recent eye-tracking studies on how people comprehend counterfactual conditionals and causal assertions. I demonstrate the relevance of this evidence to XAI and describe our recent experiments on the effects of counterfactual and causal explanations on how people understand the decisions of AI systems. I outline potential future directions for the refinement of the use of counterfactuals in XAI.

                      p As artificial intelligence has become tightly intervened in the society having tangible consequences and influence, calls for explainability and interpretability of these systems has also become increasingly prevalent. Explainable AI (XAI) attempts to alleviate concerns of transparency, trust and ethics in AI by making them accountable, interpretable and explainable to humans. This workshop aims to encapsulate these concepts under the umbrella of Explainable Agency and bring together researchers and practitioners working in different facets of explainable AI from diverse backgrounds to share challenges, new directions and recent research in the field. We especially welcome research from fields including but not limited to artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, human-robot interaction, cognitive science, human factors and philosophy.

            p The term XAI refers to a set of tools for explaining AI systems of any kind, beyond Machine Learning. Even though these tools aim at addressing explanation in the broader sense, they are not designed for all users, tasks, contexts and applications. This presentation will describe recent progress to date on XAI, with a focus on Machine Learning and its needs of semantics, by reviewing its approaches, motivation, industrial applications, and limitations.
