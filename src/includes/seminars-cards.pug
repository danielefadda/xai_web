However, besides measures of performance on downstream tasks, it is hard to understand what degree of linguistic knowledge they have and even more difficult to understand their inner workings.</span></p><p>Through linguistic probing of language models such as Bert and Roberta, I investigate their ability to encode linguistic properties and find a link between this ability and the phenomenon of outliers, parameters within language models that show unexpected behaviours. These findings help understand some of the properties that are typical of the attention mechanism at the core of such models.</p><p>Outliers also have a strong impact on the downstream performance of language models, therefore I apply these models to Named Entity Recognition in patents and study how they perform in this setting.</p><p>Finally, I present a brief study on the fine-tuning of Large Language Models to Italian.</p><p>______</p><br><p>Microsoft Teams meeting</p><br><br><b><p><strong>Join on your computer, mobile app or room device</strong></p></b><p><a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3a9a85abed0d8544a8bc86e6f8f42e599d%40thread.tacv2/1698044242903?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22c7456b31-a220-47f5-be52-473828670aa1%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22729b4d16-0567-46a8-a742-d2ae1bf09a4a%22%7d"><u>Click here to join the meeting</u></a></p><br><br><p>Meeting ID: 374 418 319 658 </p><p> </p><p>Passcode: zMGdht </p><br><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/download-app"><u>Download Teams</u></a> | <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/join-a-meeting"><u>Join on the web</u></a></p><br><br><p><strong>Or call in (audio only)</strong></p><br><p><a><u>+39 02 3056 4191,,45663040#</u></a>   Italy, Milano</p><p>Phone Conference ID: 456 630 40# </p><br><p><a href="https://dialin.teams.microsoft.com/e80d62af-367c-4976-9596-61ef054e4984?id=45663040"><u>Find a local number</u></a> | <a href="https://dialin.teams.microsoft.com/usp/pstnconferencing"><u>Reset PIN</u></a></p><br><p><a href="https://aka.ms/JoinTeamsMeeting"><u>Learn More</u></a> | <a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/meetingOptions/?organizerId=729b4d16-0567-46a8-a742-d2ae1bf09a4a&tenantId=c7456b31-a220-47f5-be52-473828670aa1&threadId=19_9a85abed0d8544a8bc86e6f8f42e599d@thread.tacv2&messageId=1698044242903&language=en-US"><u>Meeting options</u></a></p><br> <br> <br><p>______<br></p>

                        <p>In this talk, Laura will present us her work on ReasonX, a CLP-based tool for interactive reasoning-based explainability.</p><p> </p><p></p><p><strong>When &amp; Where.</strong> Thursday 12th, 11:30 @ Officine Garibaldi. Stream details below.</p><p><strong>Abstract.</strong> Explaining opaque Machine Learning (ML) models is an increasingly relevant problem. Current explanation in AI (XAI) methods suffer several shortcomings, among others an insufficient incorporation of background knowledge, and a lack of abstraction and interactivity with the user. We propose REASONX, an explanation method based on Constraint Logic Programming (CLP). REASONX can provide declarative, interactive explanations for decision trees, which can be the ML models under analysis or global/local surrogate models of any black-box model. Users can express background or common sense knowledge using linear constraints and MILP optimization over features of factual and contrastive instances, and interact with the answer constraints at different levels of abstraction through constraint projection. We present here the architecture of REASONX, which consists of a Python layer, closer to the user, and a CLP layer. REASONX's core execution engine is a Prolog meta-program with declarative semantics in terms of logic theories.</p><br><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><br><p>________________________________________________________________________________</p><br><br><p>Microsoft Teams meeting</p><br><br><b><p><strong>Join on your computer, mobile app or room device</strong></p></b><p><a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3a9a85abed0d8544a8bc86e6f8f42e599d%40thread.tacv2/1696432157078?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22c7456b31-a220-47f5-be52-473828670aa1%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22729b4d16-0567-46a8-a742-d2ae1bf09a4a%22%7d"><u>Click here to join the meeting</u></a></p><br><br><p>Meeting ID: 341 121 035 466 </p><p> </p><p>Passcode: BHbWct </p><br><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/download-app"><u>Download Teams</u></a> | <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/join-a-meeting"><u>Join on the web</u></a></p><br><br><p><strong>Or call in (audio only)</strong></p><br><p><a><u>+39 02 3056 4191,,472432131#</u></a>   Italy, Milano</p><p>Phone Conference ID: 472 432 131# </p><br><p><a href="https://dialin.teams.microsoft.com/e80d62af-367c-4976-9596-61ef054e4984?id=472432131"><u>Find a local number</u></a> | <a href="https://dialin.teams.microsoft.com/usp/pstnconferencing"><u>Reset PIN</u></a></p><br><p><a href="https://aka.ms/JoinTeamsMeeting"><u>Learn More</u></a> | <a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/meetingOptions/?organizerId=729b4d16-0567-46a8-a742-d2ae1bf09a4a&tenantId=c7456b31-a220-47f5-be52-473828670aa1&threadId=19_9a85abed0d8544a8bc86e6f8f42e599d@thread.tacv2&messageId=1696432157078&language=en-US"><u>Meeting options</u></a></p><br> <br> <br><p>________________________________________________________________________________</p>

Nevertheless, the use of AI in critical domains has also raised significant concerns regarding its final users, those affected by the undertaken decisions, and the broader society. Consequently, recent studies are shifting their focus towards the development of human-centered frameworks that facilitate a synergistic human-machine collaboration while upholding ethical and legal standards. In this work, we present a taxonomy for hybrid decision-making systems to classify systems according to the type of interaction that occurs between human and artificial intelligence. Furthermore, we identify gaps in the current body of literature and suggest potential directions for future research.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Presenters</strong></p><p>Clara Punzi, Roberto Pellungrini, Mattia Setzu</p><br><br><br><br><br>________________________________________________________________________________<br><br>Microsoft Teams meeting<br><br><b>Join on your computer, mobile app or room device</b><a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3a9a85abed0d8544a8bc86e6f8f42e599d%40thread.tacv2/1693388217543?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22c7456b31-a220-47f5-be52-473828670aa1%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22729b4d16-0567-46a8-a742-d2ae1bf09a4a%22%7d"><u>Click here to join the meeting</u></a><br><br>Meeting ID: 377 979 699 894<br>Passcode: 6538jT<br><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/download-app"><u>Download Teams</u></a> | <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/join-a-meeting"><u>Join on the web</u></a><br><br><b>Or call in (audio only)</b><br><a><u>+39 02 3056 4191,,279538702#</u></a>   Italy, MilanoPhone Conference ID: 279 538 702#<br><a href="https://dialin.teams.microsoft.com/e80d62af-367c-4976-9596-61ef054e4984?id=279538702"><u>Find a local number</u></a> | <a href="https://dialin.teams.microsoft.com/usp/pstnconferencing"><u>Reset PIN</u></a><br><a href="https://aka.ms/JoinTeamsMeeting"><u>Learn More</u></a> | <a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/meetingOptions/?organizerId=729b4d16-0567-46a8-a742-d2ae1bf09a4a&tenantId=c7456b31-a220-47f5-be52-473828670aa1&threadId=19_9a85abed0d8544a8bc86e6f8f42e599d@thread.tacv2&messageId=1693388217543&language=en-US"><u>Meeting options</u></a>

Stream details below.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Abstract</strong></p><p>Selective classification (or classification with a reject option) pairs a classifier with a selection function to determine whether or not a  prediction should be accepted. This framework trades off coverage (probability of accepting a prediction) with predictive performance, typically measured by distributive loss functions.</p><p>In many application scenarios, such as credit scoring, performance is instead measured by ranking metrics, such as the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC). We propose a model-agnostic approach to associate a selection function to a given probabilistic binary classifier. The approach is specifically targeted at optimizing the AUC. We provide both theoretical justifications and a novel algorithm, called AUCROSS, to achieve such a goal. </p><p>Experiments show that our method succeeds in trading-off coverage for AUC, improving over existing selective classification methods targeted at optimizing accuracy.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Presenter</strong></p><p>Andrea Pugnana</p><br><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><br><p>________________________________________________________________________________</p><br><br><p>Microsoft Teams meeting</p><br><br><b><p><strong>Join on your computer, mobile app or room device</strong></p></b><p><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%253a9a85abed0d8544a8bc86e6f8f42e599d%2540thread.tacv2/1693918304957?context%3D%257b%2522Tid%2522%253a%2522c7456b31-a220-47f5-be52-473828670aa1%2522%252c%2522Oid%2522%253a%2522729b4d16-0567-46a8-a742-d2ae1bf09a4a%2522%257d&amp;sa=D&amp;source=calendar&amp;ust=1695045774618502&amp;usg=AOvVaw2AdE9f9WVeCorXS__8GBLQ" target="_blank"><u>Click here to join the meeting</u></a></p><br><br><p>Meeting ID: 371 067 477 671 </p><p> </p><p>Passcode: UC8G3W </p><br><p><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/download-app&amp;sa=D&amp;source=calendar&amp;ust=1695045774618502&amp;usg=AOvVaw0OuCiqPb9iWGKfrpR0iCFF" target="_blank"><u>Download Teams</u></a> | <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/join-a-meeting&amp;sa=D&amp;source=calendar&amp;ust=1695045774618502&amp;usg=AOvVaw1n-acllknr5LXspMSy0SBv" target="_blank"><u>Join on the web</u></a></p><br><br><p><strong>Or call in (audio only)</strong></p><br><p><a><u>+39 02 3056 4191,,15636167#</u></a>   Italy, Milano</p><p>Phone Conference ID: 156 361 67# </p><br><p><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://dialin.teams.microsoft.com/e80d62af-367c-4976-9596-61ef054e4984?id%3D15636167&amp;sa=D&amp;source=calendar&amp;ust=1695045774618502&amp;usg=AOvVaw3szxmRPBwkhnxSq0le43n_" target="_blank"><u>Find a local number</u></a> | <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://dialin.teams.microsoft.com/usp/pstnconferencing&amp;sa=D&amp;source=calendar&amp;ust=1695045774618502&amp;usg=AOvVaw2_lg6KqM7_efFRX9NKenWg" target="_blank"><u>Reset PIN</u></a></p><br><p><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://aka.ms/JoinTeamsMeeting&amp;sa=D&amp;source=calendar&amp;ust=1695045774618502&amp;usg=AOvVaw2zVwR_2VaTH1Oo71rtHEZQ" target="_blank"><u>Learn More</u></a> | <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://teams.microsoft.com/meetingOptions/?organizerId%3D729b4d16-0567-46a8-a742-d2ae1bf09a4a%26tenantId%3Dc7456b31-a220-47f5-be52-473828670aa1%26threadId%3D19_9a85abed0d8544a8bc86e6f8f42e599d@thread.tacv2%26messageId%3D1693918304957%26language%3Den-US&amp;sa=D&amp;source=calendar&amp;ust=1695045774618502&amp;usg=AOvVaw1N62hf0m9MhqYElM1TmIdv" target="_blank"><u>Meeting options</u></a></p><br> <br> <br><p>________________________________________________________________________________</p>

Yet, in real-world applications, autonomy is often run in the O-F-F mode because researchers fail to understand the human end-user’s goals, needs, and wishes. In this talk, I will share exciting research we are conducting at the nexus of human factors engineering and cognitive robotics to inform the design of explainable and interactive machine learning systems. In my talk, I will focus on our recent work on enabling machines to learn human-interpretable decision-making and control policies from interaction with their environments. I will show that our novel explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods not only improves subjective measures of end-user interaction but also improves objective performance in human-machine teaming.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Bio.</strong></p><p>Dr. Matthew Gombolay is an Assistant Professor of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech (GT) and was named Anne and Alan Taetle Early-Career Assistant Professor in 2018.

The former are capable to process high throughput data in continuous spaces; the latter class contains models which are capable to express knowledge about the abstract properties and relations between the observed data. There is no unique way to integrate these two classes of models. A first method exploits logical knowledge to impose additional supervision during the training of a (set of) neural models that predicts abstract properties and relations. This idea is implemented in Logic Tensor Networks (LTN). A second method consists in using the background knowledge to correct/revise the prediction done by a (set of) neural models. This method has been implemented Iterative Local Refinement (ILR). A third method consists in defining a hybrid model as the composition of a (set of) deep learning model(s), which abstract the continuous perceptions in a finite and abstract representation--the symbols--and a discrete model that computes a finite function on the set of abstract symbols. This method is described in Deep Symbolic Learning. In the seminar, I will briefly introduce the hybrid model described above and the mechanism used for training and inference.<br><b>Bio: </b>Luciano Serafini is a researcher in the area of Artificial Intelligence. He currently coordinates the Data and Knowledge Management Research Unit at Fondazione Bruno Kessler. He graduated in information science with a thesis on logic for knowledge representation. Since 1990 he joined Fondazione Bruno Kessler (before IRST) as a researcher in the area of logic for knowledge representation and reasoning. He proposes a formalism called Multi-Context (MC) System for the representation of modular interconnected context-dependent knowledge. MC Systems has a great influence on the semantic web area and in the area of information integration. Between 2000-2013 he worked on semantic matching heterogeneous schemas and he was the first who suggested to encode this problem in propositional satisfiability. After 2010, he started his research about integrating machine learning and logical reasoning, and in 2016 he invented Logic Tensor Network, one of the first neuro-symbolic architectures. In the last years, he also has been interested in integrating learning, acting, and planning. PropHe has been a EurAI fellow since 2020 and teaches regular courses on Knowledge representation and learning at the University of Padova.

                        <p>Dear KDDers, in this talk Jose will present us his <a href="https://facctconference.org/2023/">FAccT 2023</a> papere on Domain Adaptive Decision Trees, feel free to join!</p><p> </p><p><strong>Title.</strong> Domain Adaptive Decision Trees: Implications for Accuracy and Fairness</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Abstract.</strong> In uses of pre-trained machine learning models, it is a known issue that the target population in which the model is being deployed may not have been reflected in the source population with which the model was trained. This can result in a biased model when deployed, leading to a reduction in model performance. One risk is that, as the population changes, certain demographic groups will be under-served or otherwise disadvantaged by the model, even as they become more represented in the target population. The field of domain adaptation proposes techniques for a situation where label data for the target population does not exist, but some information about the target distribution does exist. In this paper we contribute to the domain adaptation literature by introducing domain-adaptive decision trees (DADT). We focus on decision trees given their growing popularity due to their interpretability and performance relative to other more complex models. With DADT we aim to improve the accuracy of models trained in a source domain (or training data) that differs from the target domain (or test data). We propose an in-processing step that adjusts the information gain split criterion with outside information corresponding to the distribution of the target population. We demonstrate DADT on real data and find that it improves accuracy over a standard decision tree when testing in a shifted target population. We also study the change in fairness under demographic parity and equal opportunity. Results show an improvement in fairness with the use of DADT.</p><p> </p><p><strong>When &amp; Where.</strong> June 1st, 2pm. Sala Polifunzionale @ Department of Computer Science.

The field of explainable AI (XAI) aims to enhance human understanding and promote collaboration between humans and AI by providing users with essential information about AI and its decision-making processes. At the same time, the literature on human factors has long focused on crucial factors that influence human performance, including human trust in autonomous systems. In this presentation, drawing from the literature on human-computer interaction, I delve into three significant considerations related to trust in the design of explainable systems: the foundation of trust, trust calibration, and trust specificity. Furthermore, I explore relevant literature on under-trust (algorithm aversion) and over-trust (overreliance) in technological artifacts. I will discuss common trust calibration interventions for XAI system designers and present potential paths for future research in this domain.</span></p><p> </p><p><strong>Presenter.  </strong><span>Andrea Beretta</span></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>When &amp; Where. </strong><span>May 24th, 11:30am. </span><span>Officine Garibaldi, Aula Master.

This talk will cover recent certification techniques for gradient-based explanations, i.e., how to formally prove the robustness of an explanation, as well as how such techniques can be combined with human feedback to counter spurious correlation. Finally, the talk will conclude with open discussion of future challenges at the intersection of robustness and explainability.<br><br><b>Presenter.</b> Matthew Wicker<br><br><b>Bio.</b> Matthew Wicker is currently a postdoctoral research associate at The Alan Turing Institute where he works on developing formal methods for guaranteeing trustworthiness in machine learning.

In my research, perturbation in the latent space with help of Gaussian mixed model for counterfactual explanation first got my attention, then I move to pertubation in latent space to achieve counterfactual explanation for image dataset on regression task. Later, I came up with an idea to reweigh samples in latent space to achieve fairness (demographic parity) for the situation where the minor group just has less samples in the dataset.

In this presentation, I will introduce two major contributions: First, the development of VCnet, a self-explaining model for counterfactual generation. VCnet combines a predictor and a counterfactual generator that are jointly trained to generate counterfactuals that are close to the distribution of the predicted class. The proposed method employs a variational autoencoder that is conditioned to the output of the predictor to generate realistic counterfactuals. VCnet is capable of generating predictions as well as counterfactual explanations without having to solve another minimization problem. Second, the proposal of a new framework, CROCO, for generating robust counterfactual explanations regarding counterfactual input changes. This form of robustness is particularly challenging as it involves a trade-off between the robustness of the counterfactual and the proximity with the example to explain. CostRC generates robust counterfactuals while effectively managing this trade-off and guarantees the user a minimal robustness. Empirical evaluations on tabular datasets confirm the relevance and effectiveness of the proposed approach.<b><br></b><br><b><br></b><br><b>Bio:</b><br>Victor Guyomard is a third year PhD student at Orange and Irisa lab in Brittany, France. He is passionate about the field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), and the title of his thesis is "explain an invididual decision made by an AI". Specifically, his research delves into counterfactual explanations particularly the generation of realistic and robust counterfactual explanations.

In this approach, the oracle is a trained neural network. We consider Angluin’s classical algorithm for exact learning Horn theories and study the necessary changes to make it applicable to learn from neural networks. In particular, we have to consider that trained neural networks may not behave as Horn oracles, meaning that their underlying target theory may not be Horn. We propose a new algorithm that aims at extracting a Horn-approximation of the target theory and that is guaranteed to terminate in exponential time (in the worst case) and in polynomial time if the target is Horn. To showcase the applicability of the approach, we perform experiments on BERT based language models and extract rules that expose biases in these models.<br><br><b>Presenter</b><br>Ana Ozaki<br><br><b>Bio</b><br>Ana Ozaki is an associate professor at the University of Bergen, Norway. Her research area is Artificial Intelligence (AI). She is an AI researcher in the field of knowledge representation and reasoning and in learning theory.<br>Ozaki is interested in the formalisation of the learning phenomenon so that questions involving learnability, complexity, and reducibility can be systematically investigated and understood. Her research focuses on learning logical theories formulated in description logic and related formalisms for knowledge representation.<br>She is a member of the editorial boards of the Journal of Machine Learning Research and the Journal of Web Semantics. She has recently worked as Program Committee Chair for the 27th International Symposium on Temporal Representation and Reasoning.<br>Ozaki is fascinated by learning and reasoning processes and how they interact. There is a mode of learning which is actually how we learn very often but that is not the mode of learning we refer to when we talk about machine learning. We learn very often by posing queries (questions). Our intuition is that by obtaining answers to our questions from a teacher we can learn faster and better (more accurately) than by randomly selecting learning material. In learning theory, one can show that learners can efficiently exactly identify an unknown target concept formulated e.g. as a deterministic finite automaton, a decision tree, or a set of Horn rules if they can pose queries to a teacher.<br>Ozaki is currently working with her team on strategies to learn Horn rules from neural networks by posing them queries. She believes that exciting and recent advances in machine learning need to be complemented with theoretical development so that systems can provide formal guarantees of classification results and become trustable.<br><br><br>-----<br><br><br><br>We are looking forward to welcoming you at the event.<br><br><br><br>Kind Regards,<br><br>Fabrizio and Nico<br><br><br><br><br><br>________________________________________________________________________________<br><br>Microsoft Teams meeting<br><br>Join on your computer or mobile app<br><br><br>Click here to join the meeting&lt;<a href="https://deref-gmx.net/mail/client/_gKBGVbcTE4/dereferrer/?redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fteams.microsoft.com%2Fl%2Fmeetup-join%2F19%253ameeting_MGZkNDlmNTgtZmQ4Yi00M2JmLThmMDEtNWRiMjI4ZjNjOWY3%2540thread.v2%2F0%3Fcontext%3D%257b%2522Tid%2522%253a%25222b897507-ee8c-4575-830b-4f8267c3d307%2522%252c%2522Oid%2522%253a%252220acca1b-c0bb-40c6-8476-210f47b15899%2522%257d">https://deref-gmx.net/mail/client/_gKBGVbcTE4/dereferrer/?redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fteams.microsoft.com%2Fl%2Fmeetup-join%2F19%253ameeting_MGZkNDlmNTgtZmQ4Yi00M2JmLThmMDEtNWRiMjI4ZjNjOWY3%2540thread.v2%2F0%3Fcontext%3D%257b%2522Tid%2522%253a%25222b897507-ee8c-4575-830b-4f8267c3d307%2522%252c%2522Oid%2522%253a%252220acca1b-c0bb-40c6-8476-210f47b15899%2522%257d</a>&gt;<br><br><br><br>Learn More&lt;<a href="https://deref-gmx.net/mail/client/9tPcldHD9bA/dereferrer/?redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Faka.ms%2FJoinTeamsMeeting">https://deref-gmx.net/mail/client/9tPcldHD9bA/dereferrer/?redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Faka.ms%2FJoinTeamsMeeting</a>&gt; | Meeting options&lt;<a href="https://deref-gmx.net/mail/client/JH1scxj_Z_8/dereferrer/?redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fteams.microsoft.com%2FmeetingOptions%2F%3ForganizerId%3D20acca1b-c0bb-40c6-8476-210f47b15899%26tenantId%3D2b897507-ee8c-4575-830b-4f8267c3d307%26threadId%3D19_meeting_MGZkNDlmNTgtZmQ4Yi00M2JmLThmMDEtNWRiMjI4ZjNjOWY3%40thread.v2%26messageId%3D0%26language%3Den-US">https://deref-gmx.net/mail/client/JH1scxj_Z_8/dereferrer/?redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fteams.microsoft.com%2FmeetingOptions%2F%3ForganizerId%3D20acca1b-c0bb-40c6-8476-210f47b15899%26tenantId%3D2b897507-ee8c-4575-830b-4f8267c3d307%26threadId%3D19_meeting_MGZkNDlmNTgtZmQ4Yi00M2JmLThmMDEtNWRiMjI4ZjNjOWY3%40thread.v2%26messageId%3D0%26language%3Den-US</a>&gt; | Legal&lt;<a href="https://deref-gmx.net/mail/client/9tBii7p2aog/dereferrer/?redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.imperial.ac.uk%2Fmedia%2Fimperial-college%2Fadministration-and-support-services%2Fsecretariat%2Fpublic%2FICL---Events-privacy-notice---10-October-2018.pdf">https://deref-gmx.net/mail/client/9tBii7p2aog/dereferrer/?redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.imperial.ac.uk%2Fmedia%2Fimperial-college%2Fadministration-and-support-services%2Fsecretariat%2Fpublic%2FICL---Events-privacy-notice---10-October-2018.pdf</a>&gt;

To trust the explanations, we must first check that they reliably approximate the model behaviour. This becomes a complex task due to the lack of a ground truth specifying what defines a correct explanation. Even if different feature attribution methods have been proposed in the literature, there is no standardization of the metrics to assess and select these methods. In our work, we introduce an evaluation score for feature attribution methods designed to quantify their coherency to the task. We call it the Focus. To calculate this score, we generate mosaics composed of instances of different classes, and we apply, on top of them, the explainability method under assessment. The Focus metric will measure the proportion of attribution lying on the correct squares with respect to the total mosaic attribution.</p><p>On the other hand, explainability can also be used for bias detection. This process typically consists of a domain expert visualizing all the explanations in order to find unwanted biases. However, the vast amount of samples the domain experts must review makes this task more challenging as the dataset grows. In an ideal case, the system should provide domain experts only with a small number of selected samples containing potential biases. Since the Focus errors may correspond to visual biases in the model, the Focus score seems to be a promising tool for the selection of those samples containing potential unwanted biases.</p><p></p><p></p><p><b>Bio</b>:</p><p>Anna Arias Duart obtained a Bachelor's degree in Telecommunications Technology and Services Engineering in 2015 from the Universitat Politècnica de València (UPV).

In this field, complex and highly nonlinear machine learning models such as ensemble models, deep neural networks, and Support Vector Machines have consistently shown remarkable accuracy in solving complex tasks. Although accurate, AI models often are “black boxes” which we are not able to understand. Relying on these models has a multifaceted impact and raises significant concerns about their transparency. Applications in sensitive and critical domains are a strong motivational factor in trying to understand the behavior of black boxes. We propose to address this issue by providing an interpretable layer on top of black box models by aggregating “local” explanations. We present GLocalX, a “local-first” model agnostic explanation method. Starting from local explanations expressed in form of local decision rules, GLocalX iteratively generalizes them into global explanations by hierarchically aggregating them. Our goal is to learn accurate yet simple interpretable models to emulate the given black box, and, if possible, replace it entirely. We validate GLocalX in a set of experiments in standard and constrained settings with limited or no access to either data or local explanations. Experiments show that GLocalX is able to accurately emulate several models with simple and small models, reaching state-of-the-art performance against natively global solutions. Our findings show how it is often possible to achieve a high level of both accuracy and comprehensibility of classification models, even in complex domains with high-dimensional data, without necessarily trading one property for the other. This is a key requirement for a trustworthy AI, necessary for adoption in high-stakes decision making applications.<br></p><br><br><br><br><br>________________________________________________________________________________<br><br>Microsoft Teams meeting<br><br><b>Join on your computer, mobile app or room device</b><a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3a9a85abed0d8544a8bc86e6f8f42e599d%40thread.tacv2/1671204581740?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22c7456b31-a220-47f5-be52-473828670aa1%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22729b4d16-0567-46a8-a742-d2ae1bf09a4a%22%7d"><u>Click here to join the meeting</u></a><br><br>Meeting ID:&nbsp;340 547 739 918<br>Passcode:&nbsp;FNLU3Y<br><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/download-app"><u>Download Teams</u></a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/join-a-meeting"><u>Join on the web</u></a><br><br><b>Or call in (audio only)</b><br><a><u>+39 02 3056 4191,,780108878#</u></a>&nbsp;&nbsp; Italy, MilanoPhone Conference ID:&nbsp;780 108 878#<br><a href="https://dialin.teams.microsoft.com/e80d62af-367c-4976-9596-61ef054e4984?id=780108878"><u>Find a local number</u></a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="https://dialin.teams.microsoft.com/usp/pstnconferencing"><u>Reset PIN</u></a><br><a href="https://aka.ms/JoinTeamsMeeting"><u>Learn More</u></a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/meetingOptions/?organizerId=729b4d16-0567-46a8-a742-d2ae1bf09a4a&amp;tenantId=c7456b31-a220-47f5-be52-473828670aa1&amp;threadId=19_9a85abed0d8544a8bc86e6f8f42e599d@thread.tacv2&amp;messageId=1671204581740&amp;language=en-US" id="ow1307" __is_owner="true"><u>Meeting options</u></a>

Since many people are exposed to information through search engines, it is fair to expect that search engines are neutral. However, search engine results do not necessarily cover all the viewpoints of a search query topic, and they can be biased towards a specific view since search engine results are returned based on relevance, which is calculated using many features and sophisticated algorithms where search neutrality is not necessarily the focal point. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the search engine results with respect to bias. In this seminar, we will firstly examine the stance (in support or against), as well as the ideological bias (conservative or liberal) in search results of two popular search engines with respect to controversial query topics such as abortion, medical marijuana, and gay marriage.<br>In the second part of this seminar, we will investigate gender bias in online education. Students are increasingly using online materials to learn new subjects or to supplement their learning process in educational institutions. Nonetheless, online educational materials in terms of possible gender bias and stereotypes which may appear in different forms are yet to be investigated in the context of search bias in a widely-used search platform. Thus, as a first step towards measuring possible gender bias, we will analyse online educational videos of YouTube in terms of the perceived, i.e. from the viewer's perspective, gender of their narrators. Then, we will evaluate possible perceived gender bias in ranked educational video search results returned by YouTube in response to queries related to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) and NON-STEM fields of education. Lastly, we will also discuss our attempts for bias mitigation in the scope of perceived gender bias in YouTube.</p><br><br><br><br><br>________________________________________________________________________________<br><br>Microsoft Teams meeting<br><br><b>Join on your computer, mobile app or room device</b><a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3a9a85abed0d8544a8bc86e6f8f42e599d%40thread.tacv2/1670422989832?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22c7456b31-a220-47f5-be52-473828670aa1%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22729b4d16-0567-46a8-a742-d2ae1bf09a4a%22%7d"><u>Click here to join the meeting</u></a><br><br>Meeting ID: 322 172 125 021 <br>Passcode: re9bSM <br><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/download-app"><u>Download Teams</u></a> | <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/join-a-meeting"><u> Join on the web</u></a><br><br><b>Or call in (audio only)</b><br><a><u>+39 02 3056 4191,,261413320#</u></a> &nbsp; Italy, Milano Phone Conference ID: 261 413 320# <br><a href="https://dialin.teams.microsoft.com/e80d62af-367c-4976-9596-61ef054e4984?id=261413320"><u>Find a local number</u></a> | <a href="https://dialin.teams.microsoft.com/usp/pstnconferencing"><u> Reset PIN</u></a><br><a href="https://aka.ms/JoinTeamsMeeting"><u>Learn More</u></a> | <a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/meetingOptions/?organizerId=729b4d16-0567-46a8-a742-d2ae1bf09a4a&amp;tenantId=c7456b31-a220-47f5-be52-473828670aa1&amp;threadId=19_9a85abed0d8544a8bc86e6f8f42e599d@thread.tacv2&amp;messageId=1670422989832&amp;language=en-US" id="ow1792" __is_owner="true"><u> Meeting options</u></a>

An example of such domains are probabilistic argumentation problems, which describe arguments and their relations under uncertainty. However, whether PLP systems can effectively model and reason over these problems is still an open question.<br>In this talk I will discuss the relations between the semantics of PLP and the semantics of probabilistic argumentation frameworks. I will establish a connection by describing a novel mapping of probabilistic argument frameworks to probabilistic logic programs. By encoding the beliefs and relations of arguments in a PLP model, we can use on probabilistic argumentation problems the traditional reasoning and learning tools available in PLP frameworks, such as conditional queries, most probable explanation queries, and parameter learning. The last part of the talk will be dedicated to an overview of smProbLog, a novel PLP framework where these tools are available.<br><b>Bio:&nbsp;</b><br>Pietro Totis completed (cum laude) a BSc in Computer Science in 2016 at Università degli Studi di Udine.<br>In 2018, he completed (cum laude) a MSc in Computer Science at Università degli Studi di Udine, after an Erasmus visit at Potsdam Universität, taking courses in the MSc in Cognitive Systems.He joined KU Leuven in 2018 as a doctoral student at the Declarative Languages and Artificial Intelligence (DTAI) Lab under the supervision of Luc De Raedt, Angelika Kimmig and Jesse Davis.

In this paper, we introduce a hybrid, model-agnostic method for rationale evaluation using dedicated test cases, similar to unit-testing in professional software development. We apply this new method in a set of machine learning experiments aimed at extracting known knowledge structures from artificial datasets from fictional and non-fictional legal domains. We demonstrate that our method allows us to analyze the rationale of black box machine learning systems by assessing which rationale elements are learned or not. We show that the networks do not learn all of the conditions that define the data despite a high classification accuracy. Furthermore, contemporary explainable AI methods cannot come to the same conclusion and thus cannot guarantee a sound rationale. Lastly, we show that the rationale can be improved by using tailor-made training data based on the results of the rationale evaluation.<br><br><b>Presenter bio</b><br>Cor Steging is PhD candidate at the University of Groningen.

It is widely believed that automation of commonsense reasoning is needed to build intelligent systems that can rival humans. We argue that answer set programming (ASP) along with its goal-directed implementation allows us to reach this automation goal. We discuss essential elements needed for automating the human thought process and show how they are realized in ASP and the s(CASP) goal-directed ASP engine developed in our lab. We also show how default rules, expressible in ASP, help solve the explainable AI problem.<br><br><b>Presenter</b><br>Gopal Gupta is Professor of Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas and co-director of its Center for Applied AI and Machine Learning.

                        <html-blob><b>Title</b><br>Effects of machine-learned logic theories on human comprehension in machine-human teaching<b><br></b><br><b>Abstract</b><br>In an era when interactions between humans and AI-driven technology become inevitable, the evaluation of human comprehension of the information provided by AI systems is essential in many domains. However, the lack of an operational definition of comprehensibility and limited empirical support in studies have become concerns in XAI. A recent work provides a distinct definition of comprehensibility which relates comprehension to the human out-of-sample classification accuracy. This definition allows an operational and objective metric of human comprehension in empirical trials as humans learn from examples of some tasks along with machine-learned explanations in a teaching curriculum. Based on this definition, we explore the effects of symbolic machine-learned explanations and presentation order of concepts on human comprehension in machine-human teaching curricula. We use Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) to derive logic theories from small data based on abduction and induction techniques. Learned theories are converted into visual and textual explanations as declarative demonstrations of obtained knowledge. We employ a novel approach to explore both the beneficial and harmful effects of machine-learned logic theories on human comprehension via multiple machine-human teaching trials. We propose the cognitive window constraints on human comprehension and new theoretical frameworks based on the Cognitive Science and Psychology literature. In our first experiment, results demonstrate both beneficial and harmful effects of explanations on human comprehension. In more recent experiments, results show that sequential teaching of concepts with increasing complexity a) has a beneficial effect on human comprehension, b) leads to human re-discovery of recursive problem-solving strategies, and c) studying machine-learned explanations allows adaptation of human problem-solving strategy with better performance.<br><br><b>Speaker</b><br>Lun Ai<br><br><b>Bio</b><br>Lun Ai is a doctoral student in the Department of Computing at Imperial College London.

However, neural network models are still regarded as black boxes, since they do not provide any human-interpretable evidence as to why they output a certain result. In this talk, we will explore a procedure to induce human-understandable logic-based theories that attempt to represent the classification process of a given neural network model, based on the idea of establishing mappings from the values of the activations produced by the neurons of that model to human-defined concepts to be used in the induced logic-based theory. Through a series of experiments, we discuss how to map the internal state of a neural network to the human-defined concepts, examine whether the results obtained by the established mappings match our understanding of the mapped concepts, and analyse the fidelity of the resulting theory and how it can be used to generate symbolic justifications for the output of neural network models.

In this talk, we will focus on the emerging direction of building neural networks that learn from natural language explanations at training time and generate such explanations at testing time. We will start with an extension of the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset with an additional layer of human-written natural language explanations for the inference relations, called e-SNLI. We will see different types of architectures that incorporate these explanations into their training process and generate them at testing time. We will further see a similar approach for vision-language models, where we introduce e-SNLI-VE, a large dataset of visual-textual entailment with natural language explanations. We will also see e-ViL, a benchmark for natural language explanations in vision-language tasks, and e-UG, the SOTA model for natural language explanation generation on such tasks. These large datasets of explanations open up a range of research directions for using natural language explanations both for improving models and for asserting their trust. However, models trained on such datasets may nonetheless generate inconsistent explanations. An adversarial framework for sanity checking models over generating such inconsistencies will be presented. Finally, we will see RExC, an architecture that grounds both prediction and explanations into background knowledge. RExC improves over the previous methods by: (i) providing two types of explanations while existing models usually provide only one type, and (ii) beating by a large margin the previous SOTA in terms of the quality of its explanations.<br>References:<br>* <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2018/file/4c7a167bb329bd92580a99ce422d6fa6-Paper.pdf">https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2018/file/4c7a167bb329bd92580a99ce422d6fa6-Paper.pdf</a><br>* <a href="https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/papers/Kayser_E-ViL_A_Dataset_and_Benchmark_for_Natural_Language_Explanations_in_ICCV_2021_paper.pdf">https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/papers/Kayser_E-ViL_A_Dataset_and_Benchmark_for_Natural_Language_Explanations_in_ICCV_2021_paper.pdf</a><br>* <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.382/">https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.382/</a><br>* A freshly accepted paper at ICML 2022 (a previous version is here <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13876">https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13876</a> and we will soon update it with the improved accepted version)<br><br><b>Presenter</b></html-blob><br><html-blob>Oana is a Research Fellow in the Department of Computer Science at the University College London, holding an Early Career Leverhulme Fellowship.

The appealing properties of neural networks have recently led to a surge of interest in differentiable neural network based methods for learning causal structures from data. So far, neural causal discovery has focused on static datasets of observational or fixed interventional origin. We introduce an active intervention targeting (AIT) method which enables a quick identification of the underlying causal structure of the data-generating process. Our method significantly reduces the required number of interactions compared with random intervention targeting and is applicable for both discrete and continuous optimization formulations of learning the underlying directed acyclic graph (DAG) from data. The proposed method is evaluated across multiple frameworks in a wide range of settings and demonstrates superior performance on multiple benchmarks from simulated to real-world data.<br><br><b>Bio</b><br>Nino Scherrer is a research intern at MILA, Montreal, under the supervision of Prof. Yoshua Bengio and Nan Rosemary Ke (DeepMind).

Such robots often face objects in cluttered situations where object recognition and semantic part segmentation become challenging tasks due to occlusion. In order to overcome this limitation, we present a novel approach based on the hierarchical Bayesian method to handle semantic parts segmentation and object recognition tasks simultaneously. This technique is integrated with a recently introduced argumentation-based online incremental learning method, thereby enabling the robot to handle a high degree of occlusion. Furthermore, we show that the model is suitable for open-ended scenarios where the number of 3D objects or object parts are not fixed and can grow over time. We have performed extensive sets of experiments to assess the performance of our approach. Experimental results show that the proposed method has a higher percentage of mean intersection over union using a smaller number of learning instances. Furthermore, we show that the resulting model produces an explicit set of explanations for the 3D object category recognition task.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Short bio</b></p><p>Hamed Ayoobi is a research assistant in the computing department of imperial college of London and a Ph.D. researcher in the artificial intelligence department of the University of Groningen, Netherlands.

With some exceptions, explanations fall in one of two families: local explanations, which aim to explain the prediction on a single instance, and global explanations, which aim to explain predictions on any instance through a set of explanations. The former locally approximates the decision boundary of the given model, thus providing local explanations, while the latter learns global approximations, thus providing global explanations. The two have complementary strengths: local explanations tend to be precise and complex, while global ones tend to be more general, simple, and less accurate.<br>In this talk, I&#39;ll introduce the Local to Global paradigm, which rejects this dichotomy and generates global explanations directly from local ones, trying to strike a balance between the accuracy and simplicity of the two. After introducing the paradigm, I&#39;ll present GLocalX, a model-agnostic Local to Global explanation algorithm for tabular models.<br><br>Short bio: Mattia Setzu is a Ph.D. candidate and research fellow at the University of Pisa, Italy. His research focus is on Explainable AI (XAI). He studies the Local to Global paradigm, in which explanations of single predictions are merged together to provide large scope explanations. His more recent interest include sub-global explainability, parametric explanations, and globally explaining language models.<br><br><br>-----<br><br><br><br>We are looking forward to welcoming you at the event.<br><br><br><br>Kind Regards,<br><br>Antonio, David and Fabrizio<br><br><br><br><br><br>________________________________________________________________________________<br><br>Microsoft Teams meeting<br><br>Join on your computer or mobile app<br><br><br>Click here to join the meeting&lt;<a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_MGZkNDlmNTgtZmQ4Yi00M2JmLThmMDEtNWRiMjI4ZjNjOWY3%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%222b897507-ee8c-4575-830b-4f8267c3d307%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%2220acca1b-c0bb-40c6-8476-210f47b15899%22%7d" target="_blank">https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_MGZkNDlmNTgtZmQ4Yi00M2JmLThmMDEtNWRiMjI4ZjNjOWY3%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%222b897507-ee8c-4575-830b-4f8267c3d307%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%2220acca1b-c0bb-40c6-8476-210f47b15899%22%7d</a>&gt;<br><br><br><br>Learn More&lt;<a href="https://aka.ms/JoinTeamsMeeting" target="_blank">https://aka.ms/JoinTeamsMeeting</a>&gt; | Meeting options&lt;<a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/meetingOptions/?organizerId=20acca1b-c0bb-40c6-8476-210f47b15899&tenantId=2b897507-ee8c-4575-830b-4f8267c3d307&threadId=19_meeting_MGZkNDlmNTgtZmQ4Yi00M2JmLThmMDEtNWRiMjI4ZjNjOWY3@thread.v2&messageId=0&language=en-US" target="_blank">https://teams.microsoft.com/meetingOptions/?organizerId=20acca1b-c0bb-40c6-8476-210f47b15899&amp;tenantId=2b897507-ee8c-4575-830b-4f8267c3d307&amp;threadId=19_meeting_MGZkNDlmNTgtZmQ4Yi00M2JmLThmMDEtNWRiMjI4ZjNjOWY3@thread.v2&amp;messageId=0&amp;language=en-US</a>&gt; | Legal&lt;<a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/administration-and-support-services/secretariat/public/ICL---Events-privacy-notice---10-October-2018.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/administration-and-support-services/secretariat/public/ICL---Events-privacy-notice---10-October-2018.pdf</a>&gt;<br><br><u></u><u></u>

Interpretability in machine learning is undoubtedly important, but the calculations of neural networks are very challenging tounderstand. Attempts to see inside their hidden layers can either be misleading, unusable, or rely on the latent space to possess properties that it may not have. In this work, rather than attempting to analyze a neural network posthoc, we introduce a mechanism, called concept whitening (CW), to alter a given layer of the network to allow us to better understand the computation leading up to that layer. When a concept whitening module is added to a CNN, the axes of the latent space are aligned with known concepts of interest. By experiment, we show that CW can provide us a much clearer understanding for how the network gradually learns concepts over layers. CW is an alternative to a batch normalization layer in that it normalizes, and also decorrelates (whitens) the latent space. CW can be used in any layer of the network without hurting predictive performance.<br><br>Bio:<br>Zhi Chen is a PhD candidate at Duke University, advised by Prof. Cynthia Rudin.

These models have the potential to achieve great accuracy in recognizing images, but they are often called "black boxes" because they generally suffer from a lack of interpretability. In fact, evidence has emerged, where some deep learning methods appeared to perform well, but based their decisions on confounding rather than truly relevant information. In this talk, I will present my work in developing a prototypical case-based interpretable neural network known as a prototypical part network (ProtoPNet), which classifies an input image by comparing various parts of the image with learned prototypical features known as prototypes. I will also present the use of a prototypical case-based interpretable neural network model for analyzing medical images, with a focus on mammograms. Such an interpretable model will automatically detect areas of anomaly (such as spiculated mass margins) and present prototypical examples of similar anomalies found in other patients as explanations for their predictions. In particular, I will discuss a human-in-the-loop training scheme, which is based on a small set of doctor-annotated images and is specifically designed to prevent the model from using confounding information. The explanations generated by our interpretable neural network for analyzing mammograms thus augments the reports generated by radiologists, and may be able to assist doctors in diagnosing patients in the future.<br><br>Bio:<br><br><br>Dr. Chen is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Maine. His research involves the design of interpretable machine learning models that can be understood (“interpreted”) by human beings. In particular, Dr. Chen is interested in developing new techniques to enhance the interpretability and transparency of machine learning models, especially deep learning models, and in applying such techniques to healthcare, finance, and other application domains, where high-stakes decisions are made and interpretability is key for whether one can trust the predictions made by machine learning models. Dr. Chen also participates in the Maine environmental DNA (eDNA) project: he is developing computational techniques to understand eDNA.
